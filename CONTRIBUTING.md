Thanks for your interest in contributing to Krypton's developer cli `kr`!

We ask that each commit of a contribution contain the following text:
```
I agree to license all rights to my contributions in each modified file exclusively to KryptCo, Inc.
```

This allows us to include your contribution in our product and to relicense it under the same license Krypton uses.
Feel free to reach out with any questions to code@krypt.co
